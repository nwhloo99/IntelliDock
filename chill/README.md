# IntelliDock
IntelliDock is an intelligent docking solution to improve docking traffic

## Introduction
With the goal of improving visibility of the availability of docking bays and showing expected timings of hauliers to arrive at the docks, IntelliDock aims to achieve this using a clear front end app to be installed on mobile devices such as phones or tablets, and an assisting server side to manage the processes, as well as allowing managers to monitor the situation on the ground more effectively.

### Cautions
Currently, the application only runs on devices without server-side support, however if the project is to be developed on, server-side support would create a more effective system

## Using the App
When users first enter the application, they will be greeted with a login page prompting users to select either warehouse user or haulier user.
